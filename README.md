# first-webpage
My first webpage using a git repository.

This file will contain credits to eventual images used on the webpage.

Expectations:
I hope to make a proper webpage with what I have learned in The Odin Project so far.
I hope to accomplish it as they have intended, of course with the room for difference 
and flexibility that The Odin Project is expecting.

Conclusion:
After a whole day of fidgeting with this, I finally finished the project the next day. 
It has been frustrating at some points, but that's to be expected.
Because I wanted to stray from the simplicity of the task, I got quite into a chaotic process. 
I did it because I wanted to add so many things that The Odin Project didn't tell me to do, 
but ultimately this helped me understand a bit of what it must feel like to be a developer. 
I had to research and figure things out I didn't know. And the things that I did learn, 
had to be revisited multiple times when the code didn't behave as I wanted it to. Ugghh! 
This has been a valuable project, though small and simple it might be.

Notes and Credit:
I wanted to be a little extra when making this project, implementing my own style and colors, 
to make it a more enjoyable learning process. I even added actual links to 
dummy pages with actual content, though not set up to the extent of the main page.
